# 📱 Projects & Experience

## GoGymSimple / GoGymSync

A mobile application for tracking gym progress, managing workout plans, and enabling shared real-time training sessions between multiple users.

	•	Built with Flutter, Firebase, Hive, and Provider
	•	Supports multi-user training, real-time updates, and user-friendly customization
	•	Includes workout history, calculators, custom exercises, and advanced data logging
	•	Continues to be improved and developed based on collected user feedback
	•	Already released and used in real-world scenarios
	•	GitHub used primarily for syncing code between machines, not for pushing every update

## Academic Projects

During my studies, I completed many projects involving:

	•	System analysis & design (UML diagrams, design patterns, requirement analysis)
	•	Database design (SQL, relational modeling, optimization)
	•	Desktop and backend development in Java, Python, and C++
	•	Building systems from the ground up using proper documentation and architecture practices
	•	Leading small development teams and coordinating tasks

## User Feedback & Iterative Development

I actively collect feedback from real users and:

	•	Improve UI/UX based on real usage
	•	Prioritize features that bring the most value
	•	Fix edge cases and optimize performance based on user reports
	•	Apply Agile-like principles for continuous delivery and regular updates

# 🚀 Interests
	•	Mobile application development & cross-platform frameworks
	•	Real-time data synchronization and cloud-based systems
	•	Clean Architecture & scalable system design
	•	Backend development, APIs, and database optimization
	•	Turning user feedback into real and meaningful improvements
